# 3D Reconstruction & Gaussian Splatting Integration Specification

## 1. Overview

**Objective:**  
Integrate a 3D Gaussian Splatting module into the AI MovieMaker architecture to enable real-time radiance field rendering and 3D scene reconstruction from 2D image inputs.

**Background:**  
Our system leverages advanced image generation models (e.g., Flux, OpenAI) along with ControlNet for layer decomposition. To render immersive 3D scenes from 2D images, we incorporate techniques from the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering" (Kerbl et al., 2023). This method uses 3D Gaussians as flexible scene primitives, optimizing their anisotropic covariance, opacity, and spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients, then rasterizes them via a fast, differentiable, tile-based renderer.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Real-Time Rendering:** Achieves real-time novel-view synthesis at high resolutions.
- **High Visual Quality:** Maintains state-of-the-art visual fidelity through anisotropic covariance optimization.
- **Efficient Training:** Competitive training times compared to NeRF-based methods.
- **Compact Representation:** Provides a compact, GPU-friendly representation of complex scenes.

## 2. System Architecture Integration

### 2.1 High-Level Integration

Our overall system architecture is extended to include a dedicated **3D Reconstruction Module** that implements the 3D Gaussian Splatting technique. This module fits into the AI Generation Engine layer of our architecture as follows:

•	ControlNet Module: Decomposes 2D images into layers (background, foreground, subject, depth, color channels).
•	3D Reconstruction Module: Uses the output from ControlNet along with 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct and render 3D radiance fields.
•	Integration: The generated 3D scene is then rendered back into our infinite canvas UI as part of the final video composition.

### 2.2 Detailed Workflow

	1.	Input Acquisition:
	•	2D images and camera calibration data (via SfM) are input into the system.
	2.	Layer Decomposition (ControlNet):
	•	Decomposes each image into key layers: background, foreground, subject, objects, depth maps, and color channels.
	3.	3D Gaussian Initialization:
	•	Uses sparse points from SfM as initial centers.
	•	Initializes 3D Gaussians with an isotropic covariance which is then optimized into an anisotropic covariance.
	4.	Optimization & Adaptive Density:
	•	Optimizes 3D Gaussians’ positions, opacity (α), anisotropic covariance (via scaling and quaternion rotation), and SH coefficients.
	•	Applies adaptive density control: cloning small Gaussians and splitting larger ones.
	5.	Differentiable Rasterization:
	•	A fast, tile-based rasterizer projects the 3D Gaussians onto 2D.
	•	Uses α-blending with anisotropic splatting, visibility sorting, and shared memory optimization (via CUDA).
	6.	Real-Time Rendering & Output:
	•	The output is a rendered 2D image from the optimized 3D representation.
	•	This image is integrated into the movie generation pipeline (scene assembly, frame interpolation, etc.).

## 3. Technical Details & Equations

### 3.1 3D Gaussian Representation

Each 3D Gaussian is defined as:
[
G(x) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x - \mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x - \mu)}
]
Where:
	•	(\mu) is the mean (position) of the Gaussian.
	•	(\Sigma) is the 3D covariance matrix, represented as:
[
\Sigma = RSS^TR^T
]
with (S) being a scaling matrix and (R) a rotation matrix represented via a unit quaternion.

### 3.2 Projection to 2D

The projection of a 3D Gaussian onto the image plane is computed via the Jacobian (J) of the projective transformation:
[
\Sigma’ = J W \Sigma W^T J^T
]
By dropping the third dimension, we obtain a 2×2 covariance matrix suitable for 2D splatting.

### 3.3 Optimization and Differentiable Rasterization
	•	Loss Function:
[
L = (1 - \lambda) L1 + \lambda L_{D-SSIM}
]
where (\lambda = 0.2) is typically used.
	•	Rasterization:
The scene is divided into tiles; for each tile, a fast GPU Radix sort is applied to the 3D Gaussians, followed by α-blending through anisotropic splatting.

## 4. Database & API Considerations

### 4.1 Database Schema

Refer to the earlier ERD and JSON schemas. Ensure that scene metadata includes additional fields for 3D Gaussian parameters:
	•	gaussians: Array of objects containing:
	•	position: [x, y, z]
	•	scale: [s_x, s_y, s_z]
	•	rotation: Quaternion [q_w, q_x, q_y, q_z]
	•	opacity: α value
	•	sh_coefficients: Spherical Harmonics coefficients

### 4.2 API Endpoints

Develop REST/GraphQL endpoints for:
	•	Uploading Images & Camera Data:
Accept multi-view images, SfM calibration data.
	•	Triggering 3D Reconstruction:
API endpoint to initiate optimization and reconstruction.
	•	Fetching Rendered Scenes:
Retrieve rendered outputs and intermediate Gaussian parameters.
	•	Real-Time Updates:
Stream progress updates and agent feedback during optimization.

## 5. Code Examples

### 5.1 3D Gaussian Initialization (Python Pseudocode)

```python
import numpy as np
from pyquaternion import Quaternion

def initialize_gaussian(sfm_point):
    # sfm_point: [x, y, z]
    mu = np.array(sfm_point)
    # Initial isotropic covariance
    sigma_initial = np.eye(3) * 0.1  
    # Decompose covariance as scaling and rotation
    s = np.array([0.1, 0.1, 0.1])
    q = Quaternion()  # Identity quaternion
    return {
        "mu": mu,
        "scale": s,
        "rotation": q.elements,
        "opacity": 0.5,
        "sh_coefficients": np.zeros((9,))  # For example, 9 coefficients
    }
```

### 5.2 Differentiable Rasterization (CUDA Pseudocode Concept)

```cpp
// Pseudocode for tile-based rasterization kernel
__global__ void rasterizeTile(Gaussian *gaussians, Tile *tile, Pixel *output) {
    // Load Gaussian data into shared memory
    __shared__ Gaussian sharedGaussians[NUM_GAUSSIANS_PER_TILE];
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    if(tid < tile->gaussianCount) {
        sharedGaussians[tid] = gaussians[tile->startIndex + tid];
    }
    __syncthreads();

    // For each pixel in the tile, blend Gaussians front-to-back
    int pixelId = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + tid;
    if(pixelId < tile->numPixels) {
        float4 color = make_float4(0.0f);
        float alphaAccum = 0.0f;
        for(int i = 0; i < tile->gaussianCount; i++){
            // Compute contribution based on 2D projected Gaussian
            float contribution = computeAlpha(sharedGaussians[i], pixelId);
            color += contribution * sharedGaussians[i].color;
            alphaAccum += contribution;
            if(alphaAccum >= 0.99f) break;
        }
        output[pixelId] = color;
    }
}
```

## 9. Image Generation Providers Implementation

To support high-quality image generation, the system will integrate two primary providers:

1. **OpenAI Image Generation API**
2. **Flux Model on Replicate (by Black Forest Labs)**

### 9.1 OpenAI Image Generation API

We will use the OpenAI Python library to generate images from text prompts. Below is a sample implementation:

1. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install openai

```


2.	Sample Code:

```python
import openai

# Set your API key (ensure this key is kept secure)
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

# Make an image generation request
response = openai.Image.create(
  prompt="A futuristic city skyline at sunset, with flying cars and neon lights",  # Customize as needed
  n=1,  # Number of images to generate
  size="1024x1024"  # Options: "256x256", "512x512", "1024x1024"
)

# Retrieve the generated image URL
image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
print("Generated Image URL:", image_url)

```

3.	Key Points:
	•	The openai.api_key must be securely stored and managed.
	•	The prompt is dynamically generated from the user’s inputs (e.g., prompt-to-frame mapping).
	•	The response includes a URL that points to the generated image, which can be stored or used in subsequent processing steps (e.g., as a reference for scene regeneration).

9.2 Flux Model on Replicate

For additional image generation capabilities, especially when a different style or quality is desired, we will use the Flux model available via Replicate. The following steps outline the integration:

1.	Installation:

```bash
pip install replicate
```

2.	Environment Setup:
•	Set the REPLICATE_API_TOKEN environment variable:

```bash
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN='your-api-token-here'
```

3.	Sample Code:

```python
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",
    input={
        "prompt": "black forest gateau cake spelling out the words \"FLUX SCHNELL\", tasty, food photography, dynamic shot",
        "go_fast": True,
        "megapixels": "1",
        "num_outputs": 1,
        "aspect_ratio": "1:1",
        "output_format": "webp",
        "output_quality": 80,
        "num_inference_steps": 4
    }
)
print(output)
```

4.	Key Points:
	•	The replicate.run function is used to invoke the Flux model.
	•	The prompt is dynamically generated based on user inputs.
	•	The output is a list of URLs pointing to the generated images, which can be used similarly to the OpenAI API output.
    4.	Key Points:
	•	The Flux model offers a different style and speed option for image generation.
	•	Input parameters (prompt, aspect ratio, quality, etc.) can be dynamically set based on user inputs or system defaults.
	•	The output from Flux is typically a URL or binary image that is integrated into the overall image generation pipeline.

9.3 ControlNet & Additional Models

In addition to the core image generation providers, we also support various ControlNet models for detailed image manipulation. For example, models such as ControlNet Scribble can be used to condition image outputs on sketches or edge maps.

Resources:
	•	ControlNet Models: Replicate ControlNet Search
	•	3D Gaussian Splatting Repo: Gaussian Splatting on GitHub

Integration into the Pipeline
	•	The Prompt Processor module generates dynamic text prompts from user input.
	•	Depending on the selected provider, the system routes the prompt to either the OpenAI API or the Flux model on Replicate.
	•	The output image is then used as input for the ControlNet Module to decompose the image into layers (background, foreground, subject, etc.).
	•	The 3D Reconstruction Module uses these decomposed layers along with optimized 3D Gaussians to build the radiance field for real-time rendering.

This integration ensures that the system can leverage the best available image generation technology to create high-quality visual assets for movie generation.

Note: All API keys and tokens must be securely managed using environment variables or a secure vault system. Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms should be implemented to handle API rate limits or failures.
