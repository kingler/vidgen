# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### Product Description:
**AI MovieMaker** is an all-in-one platform for generating cinematic scenes and full-length movies through advanced AI. Users can input narrative prompts, upload reference images, and interact with an infinite canvas editor to iteratively generate and refine scenes.

### Key Features:
- **Onboarding Flow:** Guided prompt construction with interactive choices (genre, setting, characters, conflict, tone, visual style).
- **Infinite Canvas Editor:**  
  - **Zoomed-In View:** Detailed scene editing with inline prompt editing, image drag-and-drop zones, and frame strips.
  - **Zoomed-Out View:** Organized grid view of multiple stories and scenes.
- **Scene Refinement Tools:**  
  - Key frame linkage viewer with editable dependencies (subject, style, pose, lighting, camera, etc.).
  - Frame diff indicator to visualize changes between frame versions.
- **ControlNet Integration:**  
  - Advanced image generation with layer separation (background, foreground, subject, depth, color channels).
  - Scripting interface for per-frame camera and pose adjustments.
- **Regeneration & Branching:**  
  - Options to regenerate scenes, branch narratives, and maintain continuity.
  
### User Stories:
- **As an indie filmmaker**, I want to generate a sequence of scenes using AI so that I can create a movie without a large budget.
- **As a digital artist**, I want to refine each scene by adjusting prompts and reference images inline, so I can iterate quickly on my visual style.
- **As a content creator**, I want to view a diff of frame changes to understand how my modifications affect the output.
- **As a creative director**, I want an infinite canvas that organizes my scenes and story arcs both horizontally (progression) and vertically (branching options).

## 2. Product Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Onboarding Flow:**
   - Guided interactive prompt construction (genre, setting, characters, conflict, tone, style).
   - Live prompt preview that updates as the user makes selections.
   - Option to upload reference images with tag selection (Style, Subject, Theme).

2. **Infinite Canvas Editor:**
   - **Zoomed-In View:**  
     - Central scene preview area (60% of space).
     - Inline editable prompt box.
     - Toolbar for scene actions (Edit, Regenerate, Continue).
     - Drag-and-drop reference image zone (2×2 grid).
     - Timeline/frame strip at the bottom.
   - **Zoomed-Out View:**  
     - Organized grid displaying story blocks (horizontal progression) and shot iterations (vertical stacking).
     - Zoom controls to progressively reveal peripheral scenes.

3. **Scene Refinement & Branching:**
   - Key frame linkage viewer and editor with dependency editing.
   - Propagation toggles for inherited properties.
   - Lock/unlock indicators for fixed traits.
   - Frame diff indicator showing “before” and “after” changes.
   - Branching functionality to create alternate scene iterations.

4. **ControlNet Integration & Scripting:**
   - Decompose images into layers (background, foreground, subject, object, depth, color channels).
   - Scripting interface for per-frame instructions (e.g., camera pan, pose changes).
   - Real-time agent activity feedback (Narrative, Image Gen, Continuity, Stylization).
   - Regeneration logic with prompt-to-frame dependency mapping.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Performance:**  
  - Real-time responsiveness in scene generation and preview.
  - Scalable cloud infrastructure to handle AI inference.
- **Usability:**  
  - Intuitive, minimalistic UI with progressive disclosure.
  - Inline editing with autosave and live feedback.
- **Reliability:**  
  - Robust error handling for agent failures and continuity conflicts.
  - Consistent visual output across different scenes.
- **Security:**  
  - Secure user authentication and data storage.
  - Compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

## 3. Product Roadmap & Timeline

### Milestones:
- **MVP Development:**  
  - Onboarding Flow and basic infinite canvas editor – 3 sprint cycles (6 weeks)
  - Core scene generation and inline prompt editing – 2 sprint cycles (4 weeks)
  - ControlNet integration and basic regeneration logic – 3 sprint cycles (6 weeks)
  
- **Beta Launch:**  
  - User testing with indie filmmakers and digital artists – Estimated launch: 6 months from project start
  - Incorporate feedback and refine UI/UX
  
- **Full Product Launch:**  
  - Feature enhancements (advanced branching, real-time agent feedback) – Additional 3–4 sprint cycles (8–10 weeks)
  - Marketing and scaling phase

### Sprint Cycles:
- **Sprint 1-3:** Develop onboarding flow, live prompt preview, and basic infinite canvas.
- **Sprint 4-5:** Integrate inline prompt editing, drag-and-drop zones, and timeline functionality.
- **Sprint 6-8:** Implement scene refinement tools, key frame viewer, and branch functionality.
- **Sprint 9-11:** ControlNet integration, scripting interface, and agent activity feedback.
- **Sprint 12:** Final testing, bug fixing, and beta release preparations.

## 4. Product Organization & Team Roles

- **Product Manager:** Oversees product vision, roadmap, and stakeholder communication.
- **UX/UI Designers:** Create wireframes, prototypes, and user testing.
- **Front-End Developers:** Implement the UI based on provided designs.
- **Back-End Developers/AI Engineers:** Integrate AI models (Flux, OpenAI, ControlNet), and build generation pipelines.
- **QA & Testing:** Ensure performance, usability, and stability.
- **Marketing & Support:** User acquisition, community engagement, and technical support.

## 5. User Persona & Use Cases

Refer to the detailed user personas developed during the design phase (e.g., Indie Filmmaker Alex Rivera). Use cases include:
- Generating a full narrative movie sequence from a text prompt.
- Refining and branching individual scenes.
- Reviewing frame diffs and regenerating scenes in real time.
- Seamless integration between 2D image input and immersive 3D scene output.
